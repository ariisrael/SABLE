mission however courts loath interpret affirmative duties made statutorily explicit likely faithfulness fidelity merely requires school board member refrain egregious abuses power harm district

assessments difficult disprove oath honesty found small number states glance appears subsumed oath fidelity after faithfulness dishonesty seem incompatible however states decided include clauses oaths thus suggesting significant distinction indeed basic canon statutory construction holds far possible legislatures draft statutes without redundancies avoid rendering similar sounding clauses meaningless stretch imagination undesirable acts prevented clause example absent duty honesty board member may lie board members influence board decision lie sincerely done good school district oath impartiality found small number states seems target those acts inherently biased bias covered quite possible official actions motivated nepotism fall under clause alone fact most states felt required

discriminatory actions discrimination race religion possibly partisanship finally complicate matters oaths explicitly require officers agree conflicts interest while serving office additional
