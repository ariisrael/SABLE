property reasonably necessary accomplish exempt purpose under current practice most requirements institution purely public charity qualify property tax exemption provided court decisions rather statute foremost definition constitutes charity considered court cases recent decision under rainbow child care center inc county minnesota supreme court defined core characteristic charitable institution institution must something away organization meet criterion providing good service free below market rates junior achievement minneapolis inc state minnesota supreme court interpreted lessening burden government factor consider institution purely public charity qualify property tax exemption since factor discussed length pertains granting exemptions assembly homes inc yellow medicine county court decided nursing home exempt property taxes institution purely public charity issue case whether institution served charitable organization while charging rates clientele similar rates charged elsewhere state minnesota non exempt nursing homes payments received assembly homes inc made county welfare boards federal institutions veterans administration court decided exemption allowable based several factors rates services years courts basically used step analysis determining exemption organization does something benefits people organization does does produce material profits private interests criteria greatly expanded under guidelines set forth north star research institute county case six guidelines extensively used determining tax exempt eligibility institutions purely public charity north star case held following six guidelines useful deciding tax exempt claims whether stated purpose undertaking helpful others without immediate expectation material reward whether entity involved supported donations gifts whole part whether recipients charity required pay assistance received whether income received gifts donations charges users produces whole part profit charitable institution whether beneficiaries charity restricted unrestricted restricted whether class persons whom charity made available having reasonable relationship charitable objectives whether dividends form substance assets upon dissolution available private interests six guidelines need met none six guidelines carries weight any further lessening burden government requirement aforementioned junior achievement case understood subfactor fifth institutions seeking property tax exemption deal unpredictability terms whether criteria met qualify property exemption organizations had exempt property may felt definition six factors had met counties noted application north star factors determining property tax exemption eligibility yet unpredictability criteria used granting

free reduced rate compared local market thereby satisfying north star factor three institution qualify property tax exemption past numerous court cases cited north star factors whole while providing six factors needed met factor determinative eligibility exemption supreme court held under rainbow north star factor core characteristic institution public charity clarify third factor must satisfied organization deemed institution purely public charity emphasis added required expectation considered charity taxation purposes institution must offer free reduced rates services among issues problematic definable local market compare rates pre set government entities nonprofit groups state felt under rainbow decision drastically change ability organizations exempted property taxes department revenue did feel decision represented change memorandum county assessors following decision stated years held entity qualify institution purely public charity must sort gift charity department did understand court decision constitute change had current assessment practices response legislation requiring survey assessment practices providing moratorium granting exemptions charitable institutions department revenue invited various members minnesota nonprofit organizations discuss concerns potential changes exempt status institutions charitable organizations felt risk losing tax exempt status third north star factor met based upon court interpretation necessary charitable activities example organizations meals wheels felt threatened based fact similar organizations judge market rate soon became clear discussions enough address concerns clarifying legislation likely needed spring nonprofit organizations department discussed might possible introduce bill seek expand eligibility reinstate eligibility understood before after under rainbow decision fear selective enforcement discussed hinder equalization tax process legislative session nearing end determined best course seek moratorium assessment practices regards institutions purely public charity granted minnesota laws chapter article section along directive survey county assessors practices moratorium allowed assessment nonprofit communities discuss concerns over prevent changes landscape exempt charitable organizations points discussion contained report while groups agree compromise difficult while remaining assured exemption guidelines change much progress made determining criteria most important groups terms granting predictability charitable institutions seeking property tax exemption

requirements information gathered various above mentioned meetings between groups survey july minnesota counties city minneapolis sent survey regarding assessment practices institutions purely public charity counties minnesota counties city minneapolis responded crow wing lake counties did respond survey each jurisdiction asked submit information regarding following types exempted institutions nursing homes centers youth activity centers group homes institutions further each jurisdiction asked submit answers following five questions jurisdictions standard practices policies used determining exempt status institutions purely public charity criteria might jurisdictions determine institution eligible property tax exemption jurisdictions require institution provide goods services free jurisdictions consider government payments goods services below market prices donations jurisdictions consider government grants donations general review survey results allowed us identify following types institutions commonly reported survey institutions purely public charity exempted property tax nursing homes centers group homes youth activity centers boy scouts girl scouts youth camps etc animal shelters humane society nature history preservation sites museums nature conservancy land etc sobriety based organizations aa rehabilitation etc senior citizen centers organizations devoted training disabled persons ymca buildings crisis pregnancy centers salvation army locations american red cross sites food shelf food bank locations land owned habitat humanity after homes built land property becomes taxable transitional housing facilities housing services persons physical mental disabilities art cultural institutions several above property types separate specific statutory exemptions senior citizens centers transitional housing facilities answers given jurisdictions concerning criteria used determining exempt status institution purely public charity varied widely example profit status organization considered necessary respondents jurisdictions noted examine organizations articles incorporation laws irs form respondents jurisdictions specifically listed six north star factors guideline granting exemption representing approximately respondents reflects understanding familiarity north star case possible jurisdictions north star factors guidelines exemption number simply reflects those respondents specifically mentioned case factors determinative reasons given granting exemption vary example douglas county responded determine via application whether applicant competes taxable entity whether organization provides service government normally provide otherwise provide swift county reviews applications assessors counties similar properties owned same entity exempted counties noted seek advice department revenue question arose city minneapolis request funding information organization supported grants county hold meeting any newly applying organization answers equally varied asked criteria used determine organization eligible exemption typically profit status noted reason denying exemption exclusion certain persons inability pay reasons factor denying exemption further lack substantial donations advice department revenue county attorneys may used county noted failure meet north star factors cause deny exemption cass county answered question whether organization lessened burden government further douglas le marshall mower rock counties noted lessening burden government consideration county stated deny exemption property used purposes organization example rented non exempt entity freeborn county noted exemption granted similar profit organization offered same goods services same price clear guidelines used feeling based opposed fact based criteria possible verify through documentation statuses articles incorporation amount donations fees charged etc however criteria less obvious terms proving defining charity lessening burden government competition market etc respondents said did require institutions provide goods services free below market prices representing approximately respondents however counties require practice remaining respondents difficulty ascertaining market prices lack similar organizations made question unanswerable counties said while factor regarded sole determining factor used whether exemption granted determination market rates discussed problem members nonprofit community concerning whether government payments goods services considered donations respondents consider donations while jurisdictions did respond example county refers questions county attorney government grants respondents consider donation while again counties unable provide clear answers question stated maybe considered donations very clear inconsistencies regards assessment practices institutions purely public charity wide variety exempted institutions did lend itself being helpful example following types property inexplicably granted exemption institutions purely public charity lake association property houses weed removal equipment pet cemetery property used house music collection nonprofit music lending library storage local brass band wagon band equipment property used storage maintenance groomer vehicles state snowmobile trails community garden christian bookstore storage facility land lakes choirboys survey analysis stated department revenue had opportunity meet number occasions members nonprofit sector within state minnesota analyze survey results direction may given towards legislation based survey results analysis department revenue presents following issues recommended actions pertaining issue lack predictability regards granting exemption unequal issues recommendations assessment practices throughout state recommendation clear legislative direction add transparency predictability nonprofit community terms exemptions granted department revenue minnesota council minnesota association assessing officers legislative staff worked develop generally agreed upon language made great progress toward goal importantly department revenue council agree any language should neither restrict nor expand eligibility requirements property tax exemption institutions purely public charity believe language presented adds necessary level predictability issue currently exempt nursing homes substantial level donations required charities under under rainbow decision recommendation separate legislation providing specific exemption nonprofit nursing homes discharge patients inability pay issue statutory guidelines confusion nonprofit community concerning types government payments eligible considered donations further definition government grants continuously debated between groups recommendation statutory guidelines concerning types government payments qualify donations reduce sense obscurity nonprofit community while agreement made issue purpose having drafted language department revenue feels definition included might expand current exemptions although nonprofit sector does share concern feel prudent address fact agreement resulting compromise language intended deviate agreed upon purpose expand exemptions issue throughout meetings groups agreed utmost importance statutory language neither expands nor contracts current practice understood potential exists word cause expansion contraction current practice nearly impossible language does change current landscape language developed represents committee best efforts redefine add statutory clarification neither expand nor contract current practices spite everyone best efforts intentions each group still concerned potential changes exempt status institutions due potential interpretation language recommendation provide sense security groups terms granting exemptions department revenue minnesota association assessing officers minnesota council recommend creation three member review board comprised member representing each minnesota association assessing officers minnesota council nonprofit community institutions purely public charity county assessors able review tax status property board receive non binding recommendation prior lieu appeal tax court panel establish own guidelines consideration fairness equality taxpayers members nonprofit community review panel addition statutory changes defining process granting exemptions properties review board may help identify prevent any unintended consequences may arise legislation expansion contraction current exemptions recommendations needed legislative change conclusion evident survey lack uniformity throughout state terms granting denying exemptions property owned institutions purely public charity while department revenue viewed under rainbow providing clarification existing requirements nonprofit community representatives stated property owners represented felt decision potentially threatened existing exemptions difference opinion seems based genuine difference opinion impacts decision subject properties may treated past various counties based upon survey results may reasonable reason believe counties under rainbow decision affected exemptions although necessarily true counties members assessment community nonprofit community agree clear guidelines needed prevent inequalities tax status institutions notably consensus north star factors should likely codified possible minor changes eligibility requirements should neither expanded nor contracted current law various meetings between department nonprofit assessment communities over several months led compromise terms desired language stated still points groups continue discuss terms language may may change current practices example nonprofit community discussed desire language single factor determinative terms granting exemption properties charitable institutions department revenue assessment community reluctant accept language due potential expansion current practices members groups had argued north star factors definitive argument made narrow current exemption practices north star factors therefore still considered inherently determinative exempt status groups tried create language encompass idea while modifying factors better reflect current assessment practices exempt guidelines without expansion contraction importance law neither restrictive nor expansive comparison practices prior under rainbow requested members nonprofit community although little agreement achieved conflict defining current practices based upon statewide inconsistencies granting exemptions institutions department opinion under rainbow decision simply made explicit previously implied however appears based upon survey results counties various times may viewed free reduced prices necessary factor granting exemptions prior under rainbow result strong working relationships developed between groups during subsequent meetings through understanding challenges facing assessors consensus reached sort legislation successfully address issues outlined above department revenue along members assessment nonprofit communities legislative staff drafted generally agreed upon potential statutory language language product weeks meetings between department revenue minnesota council assessors representing county attorneys counties issues most troublesome terms resolving conflict distinguish between government payments services qualifying donations under several court cases government grants qualify donations under several court cases submitted draft contained appendix report includes recommended definition qualifying payments legislature may wish accept change yet another issue groups debated heavily degree legislature wants exemption property institution purely public charity based upon organization does irrespective amount type donations organization relies upon whether organization provides goods services free reduced prices example differences between nursing homes charitable organizations suggest language include separate exemption nursing homes legislature may consider separate exemption order add certainty institutions legislature may disagree approach may additional organizations belong category appendix draft bill act exempt following factors must
