discussed adjustment why needed explained without methodology another moving variable formula grain producers land uses regional adjustment offer producers predictability committee agreed regional

values dry land hay acceptable producers resulting complaints almost every area state issue intend address next reappraisal department proposes determine dry land hay productivity determining total air dried herbage acre land produce department midpoint below normal normal productivity published soil survey similar productivity determined grazing land department divide number calculate tonnage per acre advantage air dry herbage data almost always available whereas alfalfa grass legume hay data making defendable consistent additionally productivity reflective actual production land page may
