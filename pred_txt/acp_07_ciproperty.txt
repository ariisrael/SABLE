types property actions taken improve quality assessments remainder report address questions should properties assessed best practices valuation minnesota statute requires property assessed market value expectation exists through statute court decisions policies explicitly implicitly assessors only consider fee simple ownership analysis determination market value minnesota department revenue property tax division should properties assessed assessment practices classification report commercial industrial property market value defined international association assessing officers defines market value most probable price specified date cash terms equivalent cash precisely revealed terms specified property rights should sell after reasonable exposure competitive market under conditions requisite fair sale buyer seller each acting prudently knowledgeably self interest assuming neither under undue duress definitions generally imply consummation sale specific date under following

assessors value property fee simple basis expectation protects property owners valuation increases reverse true property owner had long term lease above market rent difficult imagine property tax system based upon anything fee simple concept minnesota department revenue property tax division assessment practices classification report commercial industrial property should properties assessed market value determination assessors required consideration three approaches value cost sales comparison income although three approaches should considered each approach less appropriate depending factors including limited age property uniqueness business geographic location local regional market final analysis approach typically emerge being most representative value particular area outstate areas limited number properties assessor may establish values based upon hybrid compilation three approaches cost approach premise cost approach based upon principal substitution words nothing worth costs replace structure having equal utility assessor determines replacement cost structure subject property being appraised next step consider depreciation loss value any cause improvements after depreciated improvement value determined land value added total estimate market value property being appraised primary application cost approach appraisal structures special properties lend themselves accepted approaches value income approach income approach value estimates market value annual net operating income future net incomes estimate market value income producing properties basis approach assessor market based data incomes expenses capitalization rates estimate market value tax purposes market data derived number published sources properties may may sold market data provides good indication typical incomes expenses capitalization rates subject property actual income expense data subject property analyzed may relevant valuation income expenses reflective market conditions income expenses subject differ market based information further analysis required physical problems internal external may adversely affect actual income property generates therefore affect valuation estimates issues may need considered assessor individual basis market based expenses used same reason market derived expenses accurate indication expenses should little consideration current ownership management market derived capitalization rate gives reliable indication capitalization rate typical subject property being appraised methodology precise capitalization formula requires analysis knowledge market conditions sales comparison approach premise sales comparison approach value subject property being appraised comparing subject similar properties recently sold effort estimate current market value subject property adjustments made comparable sales similar subject property thereby indication value subject property adjustments typically made size structures quality land structure construction condition structures location age structures sales fewest smallest adjustments best indication value subject property sales comparison approach requires following steps followed collection data analysis market data determine appropriate units comparison adjustment analysis adjusted sales prices estimate market value subject property minnesota department revenue property tax division should properties assessed assessment practices classification report commercial industrial property important assessor tasks sales verification mass appraisal sales verification information essential proper completion sales approach income approach needs extracted actual market sales consequently essential commercial sales carefully reviewed verified verified sales information gained sales verification process helps determine bench marks assessor set defend valuation subject similar properties helps assessor identify outlier sales sales extremely high low ratios verification used determine outlier sales simply good sales representative market value those sales indications change market conditions verification process usually includes phone call buyer seller buyer seller representatives brokers possibly visit inspect comparable sale property questions asked include limited why property bought sold intended property after purchase financing terms any personal property included sale price sale price determined long property market exposed market offers made accurate information collected confidence appraiser sale represents does represent typical market value mass appraisal assessors utilize technique called mass appraisal assess properties case income producing properties commercial apartment property assessors certain generalizations concerning typical income expenses without ability generalizations assumptions assessors act appraisers mass appraisers although arguably result might slightly precise down side instead being able appraise even parcels appraiser fortunate complete percent assignments needed exponential expansion staff assessor offices offset any potential tax benefits might gained conclusion best assessment practices commercial industrial property must reflect requirement property appraised market value most fair equitable manner possible reflect fee simple ownership concept entire bundle rights being appraised mass appraisal process used assessors extremely important data used valuation property accurate best ensure accurate data used valuation verify sales inspections part quintile reassessment process addition assessors need communicate clearly property owners buyers sellers fellow assessors need accurate information ensure data used assessment purposes accurate gives best indication market value property
